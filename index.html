<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  The mission of the <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a> 
  project is to help scientists be more productive by teaching them basic 
  computing skills. Scientists often spend much of their time wrestling 
  with software, but most are self-taught programmers. As a result, they 
  spend hours doing things that should take minutes, reinvent a lot of 
  wheels, and still don't know if their results are reliable. To tackle 
  this problem, Software Carpentry runs two-day workshops at 
  <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/workshops/previous.html">hundreds 
  of sites around the world</a>. These hands-on workshops cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation. Participants are be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems. To coincide with the 
  <a href="http://www.amos.org.au/">Australian Meteorological and
  Oceanographic Society</a> (AMOS) National Conference, AMOS and the
  <a href="http://www.climatescience.org.au/">ARC Centre of Excellence for
  Climate System Science</a> are teaming up to deliver this workshop.
</p>

<!--
  Explain who your audience is.  (In particular, tell readers if the
  workshop is only open to people from a particular institution.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The workshop is restricted to postgraduate students (including 
  honours) and other research scientists working in the AMOS sciences 
  (i.e. meteorology, climatoloogy, oceanography, glaciology) who are 
  familiar with basic programming concepts like loops, conditionals, 
  arrays, and functions, but need help to translate this knowledge into
  practical tools to help them work more productively.

<!--
  Modify the block below if there are any special requirements.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Requirements:</strong> Participants must bring a laptop with
  a few specific software packages installed (listed <a href="#setup">below</a>).
  That laptop will need to be able to connect to the Eduroam wifi network,
  so please let the organisers know if you aren't affliated with an Australian
  tertiary instition and thus cannot access Eduroam. 
  For help connecting to Eduroam, participants should search the IT website of
  their home institution, as opposed to the University of Queensland IT website.
  Participants are also required to abide by Software Carpentry's
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Registration:</strong>
  Participants can register at the 
  <a href="http://www.imis100ap1.com.au/AMOS/AMOS2015/Home/AMOSNationalConference2015/Home.aspx">AMOS conference website</a>
  at the same time as registering for the conference itself. 
  The fee is $90 for students and $140 otherwise, 
  which is used to pay an administratve fee to the Software Carpentry Foundation and
  to assist the volunteer instructors with their accommodation expenses.
  At the registration site it is possible to register 
  for the workshop alone (i.e. and not the conference as well), however just 
  note that the workshop is only open to people working/studying in the AMOS 
  sciences. Registrations for the workshop will close on Friday 12 June or when the venue 
  capacity (50 people) has been reached, whichever comes first. Note that it 
  is not anticipated that people who attended the Software Carpentry workshop 
  prior to the AMOS conference in Hobart (Feb 2014) will also attend this one, 
  as the teaching content will be very similar.

<div> <!-- Start of 'editor' section. -->
  <h3>1. Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by ':q!' (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
	<code>nano</code> is the editor installed by the Software
	Carpentry Installer, it is a basic editor integrated into the
	lesson material.
      </p>
      <p>
	<a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a> is a
	popular free code editor for Windows.  Be aware that you must
	add its installation directory to your system path in order to
	launch it from the command line (or have other tools like Git
	launch it for you).  Please ask your instructor to help you do
	this.
      </p>

    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
	We recommend
	<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">Text Wrangler</a> or
	<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
	In a pinch, you can use <code>nano</code>,
	which should be pre-installed.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>
	<a href="http://kate-editor.org/">Kate</a> is one option for

      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
	The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
	need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
	(found in
	<code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
	Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>
	The default shell is usually <code>bash</code>, but if your
	machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a

  <h3>3. Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
	Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
	install (described above).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>For OS X 10.8 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/latest/download">the installer</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.7)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer for your
        OS <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available
        here</a>. Use the Leopard installer for 10.5 and the Snow
        Leopard installer for 10.6-10.7.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Linux</h4>
      <p>
	If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
	install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
        <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install git</code>.
      </p>

<div> <!-- Start of 'Python' section. -->
  <h3>4. Python</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> is a popular language for
    scientific computing, and great for general-purpose programming as
    well.  Installing all of its scientific packages individually can be
    a bit difficult, so we recommend an all-in-one installer.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Download and
          install <a href="https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/">Anaconda</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
          Use all of the defaults for installation

	download the installer and we'll help you at the boot
	camp.)
      </p>
      <ol>
	<li>
          Download the installer that matches your operating
          system and save it in your home folder.
	</li>
	<li>
          Open a terminal window.
	</li>
	<li>

	<li>
          Press enter. You will follow the text-only prompts.  When
          there is a colon at the bottom of the screen press the down
          arrow to move down through the text. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to approve the license. Press enter to approve the
          default location for the files. Type <code>yes</code> and
          press enter to prepend Anaconda to your <code>PATH</code>
          (this makes the Anaconda distribution the default Python).

  <h3>5. Make</h3>

  <p>
    Originally invented to manage compilation of programs written in
    languages like C, Make can be used to automatically update any set
    of files that depend on another set of files. This makes it a good
    solution for many data analysis and data management
    problems. While there are many build tools now in existence
    (e.g. ANT and CMake) they share the same fundamental concepts as
    Make. 
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Once you have installed Git Bash you can install Make by:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Download <code>make.exe</code> from <a 
            href="https://github.com/msysgit/msysgit/blob/master/bin/make.exe?raw=true">here</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Place it in the <code>bin</code> directory where you installed Git
            Bash e.g. <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin</code>.
          </li>
          <li> 
            To test: open a Git Bash window, type <code>make</code>, and press Enter.
          </li>
          <li> 
            You should see the following message
            <pre>make: *** No targets specified and no makefile found. Stop.</pre>
            This means that Make was successfully installed.
            Otherwise, you'll see this error message:
            <pre>bash: make: command not found</pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <h4>Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        For OS X, version 10.9 (Mavericks) or above, download the Command Line
        Tools by doing:    
      </p>
        <pre>xcode-select  --install</pre>
      <p>
        For more information, see the <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/">OSX Daily blog</a>.
      </p>
        If you have an older OS X version and you do not already have 
        access to <code>make</code> from within
        your shell, you will need to install XCode (which is free, but
        over a gigabyte to download). 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to the Apple app store</li>
        <li>Search for XCode</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Free</strong></li>
        <li>Click <strong>Install App</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once XCode has installed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click <strong>Applications</strong></li>
        <li>Click <strong>XCode</strong></li>
        <li>Select <strong>XCode&rarr;Preferences...</strong></li>

        <li>Select <strong>Command Line Tools</strong></li>
        <li>Click <strong>Install</strong></li>
